# Scramble?
Yes, that is the name of the program.  This program creates cool glitch effects with your screen.  Use this to prank your friends!

## Known issues
Taskbar and other Windows processes are not affected by the glitch.

Sometimes there is latency.

Window is still visible in the app switcher.  (The inability to close it via normal means is intentional.)
